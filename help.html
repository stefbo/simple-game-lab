		<a name="quickstart"></a><h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
		
		<p>
		Comments start with a <tt>#</tt> on the line.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Suppose players <i>1,..,n</i> and each of them can say "yes" or "no". Each such
 		player <i>i</i> is represented by a Boolean variable <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> which 
 		can be <i>1</i> ("yes") or <i>0</i> ("no").
 		</p>

		<p>
		Now consider a set of <i>m</i> <i>&ge;</i>-constraints and non-negative integer 
		coefficients <i>w<sub>i,j</sub></i> 
		("weights"), where <i>i</i> is the player and <i>j</i> is the constraint:
		
			<div style="font-family: serif; margin-left:50px;"><i>
     			w<sub>1,1</sub>x<sub>i</sub> + ... + w<sub>1,n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> &ge; Q<sub>1</sub><br/>
    	        <span style="text-align:center">...</span><br/>
	 			w<sub>m,1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + ... + w<sub>m,n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> &ge; Q<sub>m</sub>
			</i></div>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		One such constraint is called a <a href="#glossary_simplegames">Weighted Voting Game</a> 
		(WVG) and a	satisfying coalition is called a winning coalition (of players).
		If a coalition is winning only if is satisfies all <i>m</i> constraints, 
		then it is called <a href="#glossary_simplegames">Multiple Weights Voting Game</a> (MWVG).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		To model a MWVG as input for the laboratory the constraints have to be 
		transposed as shown below.
		The main advantage of this representation is that we can now add the names 
		of the players. You should keep in mind that the input is 
		<strong>player-oriented</strong>:
		
		<div style="margin:0px 0 5px 50px;">
			<tt>
			Q<sub>1</sub> ... Q<sub>m</sub><br/>
			w<sub>1,1</sub> ... w<sub>m,1</sub> Name of the 1-st Player<br/>
			      ...<br/>
			w<sub>1,n</sub> ... w<sub>m,n</sub> Name of the n-th Player
			</tt>
		</div>
		
		The weights on a players' line can be separated by any number of 
		spaces and tabs. The players' name ends at the end of the line.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		 As an example, consider the following two constraints:
		 	<div style="font-family: serif; margin-left:50px; margin-bottom: 5px"><i>
     			1x<sub>1</sub> + 1x<sub>2</sub> + 1x<sub>3</sub> &ge; 2
     			1x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> + 3x<sub>3</sub> &ge; 3<br/>
     		</i></div>
     	This can be modeled as:
     	<pre class="example">
# Right hand sides:
2  3
# Weights and names. Here: A, B, C
1  3 A
1  2 B
1  1 C
     	</pre>
		</p>
		
		
		<a name="syntax"></a><h2>Syntax</h2>
		The input format is made of lines. There are four types of lines: Blanks, comments, commands, quotas and classes.
		<ul>
			<li>Blank lines (lines which contain only spaces and tabs) are ignored.</li>
			<li>A <b>comment line</b> beginning with # is ignored.</li>
			<li>A <b>command line</b> begins with a %% and has the form <tt>%&lt;name> &lt;value></tt> where <tt>&lt;name</tt> is the command''s name and <tt>&lt;command></tt> is the optional value that is passed to the command. For a list of commands, see below.</li>
			<li>The <b>quota line</b>, which has to appear before any class line, contains the integer quotas for each constraint. The number of quotas determines the number of constraints.</li>
			<li>A <b>class line</b> adds a new class of players to the game and sets its weights for the constraints. This type of line is discussed in more detail below.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<a name="syntax_classes"></a><h3>Classes</h3>
		<p>
		A class line has the form
		<pre>
	(x&lt;multiplier>) &lt;weights> (&lt;name>)
		</pre>
		where <tt>(...)</tt> indicates an optional part. The multiplier indicates the number of players in the class. For instance, <tt>x5</tt> indicates 5 players. If no multiplier is given, <tt>x1</tt> is assumed.
		</p>
		<p>
		The <tt>&lt;weights></tt> has to provide a non-negative integer weight for each constraint.
		</p>
		<p>
		The <tt>&lt;name></tt> is an optional name for the player. There are no restrictions for its form. The name ends at the end of the line. 
		</p>
		
		
		<a name="syntax_commands"></a><h3>Commands</h3>
		<h4><tt>%join &lt;bool expr></tt></h4>
		
		<p>
		The <tt>join</tt> command provides a Boolean expression which describes 
		how to join the constraints. The variables are the <i>m</i> constraints 
		numbered from <i>1</i> to <i>m</i>. Boolean operations are 
		<tt>AND</tt> and <tt>OR</tt>. Negation is not allowed. The parser 
		respects precedence of conjunction over disjunction and recognizes  
		brackets.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Multiple occurrences of a variable are allowed. See also the example of
		the US Federal Legal System below. 
		</p>
				
		<a name="syntax_examples"></a><h3>Examples</h3>
		The prominent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" target="_blank" class="external">UN Security Council</a> contains five permanent players each of which has veto power and it contains ten non-permanent players. For a resolution to pass, nine members have to vote in favor for it. This situation if often modeled as binary game with only "yes" and "no" votes. A weighted representation is <tt>[39;7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]</tt>. If we do not care on the members names, we can model it as:
		<pre class="example">
# UN Security Council - First version
     39
 x5   7 Permanent Member
x10   1 Non-permanent Member
		</pre>
		If we do care on the names of the permanent members we could model:
		<pre class="example">
# UN Security Council - Second version
     39
      7 United States
      7 Russia
      7 China
      7 France
      7 United Kingdom
x10   1 Non-permanent Member
		</pre>
		Even though the weighted representation is well known for this game, the fact that we express two different rules (veto power and "9 out of 15") in a single constraint it not optimal. For example, consider the following model which uses two constraints:
		<pre class="example">
# UN Security Council - Third version
      5  9
 x5   1  1 Permanent Member
x10   0  1 Non-permanent Member
		</pre>
		This model is much more obvious in that the first constraint models veto power of the permanent members and the second models the "9 out of 15" rule.  
		
		<p>
		We now consider a more complicated example, viz. the <b>US Federal Legal System</b>. 
		The players are the 100 <b>members of the senate</b>, the 435 <b>members of the house of representatives</b>, 
		the <b>president of the United States</b> and the <b>vice president of the United States</b> which is 
		the president of the senate.
		
		A bill passes if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
		<ul>
			<li>51 senators and 218 representatives vote in favor and the president does not veto the bill.</li>
			<li>50 senators, the vice president and 218 representatives vote in favor and the president does no veto it.</li>
			<li>67 senators and 290 representatives approve the bill.</li>
		</ul>
		As the president of the senate, the vice president acts as a tie-breaker if the senators are equally divided. He 
		does not have a 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tie-breaking_votes_cast_by_Vice_Presidents_of_the_United_States" class="external">regular 
		vote</a>.
		
		The game can be modeled using seven simple rules:
		<ol>
			<li>The president approves.</li>
			<li>At least 51 senators approve.</li>
			<li>At least 218 representatives approve.</li>
			<li>The vice president approves.</li>
			<li>At least 50 senators approve.</li>
			<li>At least 67 senators approve.</li>
			<li>At least 290 representatives approve.</li>
		</ol>
		
		From the description of the game above, a bill passes if
		<ul>
			<li>the rules 1, 2 and 3 are fulfilled, or</li>
			<li>the rules 1, 4, 5 and 3 are fulfilled, or</li>
			<li>the rules 6, 7 are fulfilled.</li>
		</ul>
		
		Straight from that we can derive the model of our game. The <tt>join</tt> command in the first line relates 
		the single rules as stated above.
		<pre class="example">
%join (1 AND 2 AND 3) OR (1 AND 4 AND 5 AND 3) OR (6 AND 7)
     1  51 218  1  50  67  290
x100 0   1   0  0   1   1    0 Member of the Senate
x435 0   0   1  0   0   0    1 Member of the House of Rep.
     1   0   0  0   0   0    0 President
     0   0   0  1   0   0    0 Vice-President
  		</pre>

	<h3>Simple Game</h3>
		
	Let <i>n &ge; 1</i> and <i>N={1,&hellip;,n}</i> and <i>W &sube; 2<sup>N</sup></i>. The pair 
	<i>(N,W)</i> is called a <span class="def">simple game</span> if
	<ol>
		<li><i>&empty; &notin; W</i>,</li>
		<li><i>N &isin; W</i> (not-empty) and</li>
		<li><i>&forall; S,T &isin; 2<sup>N</sup>, S &sube; T: S &isin; W &rArr; T &isin; W</i> (up-set)</li>
	</ol>
	
	The elements in <i>N</i> are called <span class="def">players</span>. Subsets of <i>2<sup>N</sup></i> are called 
	<span class="def">coalitions</span>. A coalition <i>S</i> is called <span class="def">winning</span> if 
	<i>S &isin; W</i> and it is called <span class="def">losing</span> otherwise. A coalition <i>S &isin; W</i> 
	is called <span class="def">minimal winning</span> if each proper subset is losing. The set of minimal 
	winning coalition is denoted by <i>W<sub>min</sub></i>. A coalition <i>S</i> is <span class="def">blocking</span> 
	if <i>N \ S</i> is losing.
	
	In the remainder, let <i>(N,W)</i> be a simple game.
	
	<a name="glossary_mwvg"></a>
	<h3>(Multiple) Weighted Voting Games</h3>
	
	Let <i>Q &ge; 1</i> and <i>w<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,w<sub>n</sub>&ge; 0</i> be integers. We call 
	<i>[Q;w<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,w<sub>n</sub>]</i> a <span class="def">weighted representation (of 
	<i>(N,W)</i>)</span> if
	
	<p class="centered-formula">
		<i>&forall; S &isin; 2<sup>N</sup>: &sum;<sub>i &isin; S</sub> w<sub>i</sub> &ge; Q &hArr; S &isin; W</i>.
	</p>
	
	In this case, the <i>Q</i> is called the <span class="def">quota</span> and 
	<i>w<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,w<sub>i</sub></i> are called the <span class="def">weights 
	(of the players)</span>. For <i>S&isin; 2<sup>N</sup></i> we define <i>w(S):=&sum;<sub>i&isin; S</sub> 
	w<sub>i</sub></i>.
	
	A weighted representation <i>[Q;w<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,w<sub>n</sub>]</i> is called <span class="def">homogeneous</span> 
	if for each minimal winning coalition <i>S</i> it holds <i>w(S)=Q</i>. For instance, <i>[8;6,4,3,1]</i> and 
	<i>[5;3,2,2,1]</i> represent the same game, the former representation is not homogeneous while the 
	latter is homogeneous.
	
	When we use vectors instead of scalar integers for the weights and for the quota we end up at 
	<span class="def">multiple weighted voting games</span> <small>(Also known as 
	<span class="def">vector-weighted voting games</span>)</small>. Operations like <i>+</i> and <i>&ge;</i> are 
	defined	component-wise for this. For instance, the game <i>[(2,3);(1,2),(2,1),(0,2),(1,1)]</i> is not weighted.
	
	<a name="glossary_players"></a>
	<h3>Players</h3>
	
	The preorder <i>&#8829;<sub>I</sub>&sube; N<sup>2</sup></i> is called the 
	<span class="def">at-least-as-desirable relation (on individuals)</span> and compares players with respect 
	to their abilities. Given any two players <i>i,j&isin; N</i> the relation is defined by
	
	<p class="centered-formula">
		<i>i&#8829;<sub>I</sub> j &hArr; &forall; S &sube; N\ {i,j}: S &cup; {j} &isin; W &rArr; S &cup; {i} &isin; W</i>
	</p>
	
	Two players <i>i,j &isin; N</i> are called <span class="def">symmetric</span> (denoted by <i>i&#8776;<sub>I</sub>j</i>) if <i>i&#8829;<sub>I</sub> j</i> 
	and <i>j &#8829;<sub>I</sub> i</i>.
	
	A player <i>i &isin; N</i> is called ...
	<ul>
		<li>... <span class="def">vetoer</span> if <i>&forall; S &isin; W: i &isin; W</i>.</li>
		<li>... <span class="def">dummy</span> if <i>&forall; S &isin; W<sub>min</sub>: i &notin; S</i>.</li>
		<li>... <span class="def">dictator</span> if <i>W<sub>min</sub>={i}</i>. Same as <i>N \ {i}</i> 
			are dummies and <i>i</i> is not.</li>
	</ul>
	
	If <i>(N,W)</i> has a homogeneous representation <i>[Q;w<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,w<sub>n</sub>]</i> a non-dummy 
	player <i>i</i> is called ...
	<ul>
		<li>... <span class="def">sum</span> if 
		<p class="centered-formula">
			<i>&exist; S &isin; W<sub>min</sub>, i &isin; S: &exist; T &sube; N \ S: (&forall; j &isin; T: 
			i &#8829;<sub>I</sub> j) &and; (S \ {i}) &cup; T &isin; W</i>.
		</p>
		There is a minimal winning coalition containing <i>i</i> in which <i>i</i> can be replaced by some 
		not more desirable players such that the resulting coalition is winning again.</li>
		<li>... <span class="def">step</span> if it is not a sum.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<a name="glossary_types"></a>
	<h3>Types and Models</h3>
	
	The equivalence classes of the players (called <span class="def">types</span>) of a simple game <i>(N,W)</i> w.r.t <i>&#8776;<sub>I</sub></i> are denoted 
	<i>N<sub>1</sub>,...,N<sub>t</sub>&sube; N</i> where <i>t</i> (for <b>t</b>ypes) denotes their number. Let 
	<i>A&sube; 2<sup>N</sup></i> be a set of coalitions. We call a vector <i>(m<sub>1</sub>,...,m<sub>t</sub>)&isin; &#8469;<sup>t</sup></i>
	<span class="def">a model of <i>A</i></span> if
	<p class="centered-formula">
			<i>&exist; S &isin;A : &forall; k=1,...,t : m<sub>k</sub> = |S &cap; N<sub>k</sub>|</i>.
	</p>
	Representions by models are often applied to the sets of the winning, the minimal winning and the
	shift-minimal winning coalitions. A simlar statement holds for the corresponding sets of the losing
	coalitions. 
	
	<a name="glossary_properties"></a>
	<h3>Properties</h3>
	
	The simple game <i>(N,W)</i> is called ...
	<ul>
		<li>... <span class="def">complete</span> if <i>&#8829;<sub>I</sub></i> is total. 
			<small>Synonyms are <span class="def">total</span> and <span class="def">swap-robust</span>.</small></li>
		<li>... <span class="def">directed</span> if <i>1&#8829;<sub>I</sub> 2 &#8829;<sub>I</sub> &middot;&middot;&middot; &#8829;<sub>I</sub> n</i>.</li>
		<li>... <span class="def">consecutive</span> if for each <a href="#glossary_types">type</a> <t>k=1,...,t</t> it holds <i>N<sub>k</sub>={min N<sub>k</sub>,...,max N<sub>k</sub>}</i>. Directed games are always consecutive. Complete games are not.</li>
		<li>... <span class="def">weighted</span> if it has a weighted representation.</li>
		<li>... <span class="def">homogeneous</span> if it has a homogeneous weighted representation.</li>
		<li>... <span class="def">proper</span> if <i>&forall; S &isin; W: N \ S &notin; W</i>.</li>
		<li>... <span class="def">strong</span> if <i>&forall; S &notin; W: N \ S &notin; W</i>.</li>
		<li>... <span class="def">decisive</span> if it is proper and strong.</li>
