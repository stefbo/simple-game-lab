This is an example how to use the core of the laboratory into a standalone
exectuable using the JavaScript Shell shipped with Mozilla SpiderMonkey. See
[1] for details.

If you intent to start the executable from a different place, use have to fix
the path to the laboratory files in benchmark.js first. The program can be started
with

	$ js benchmark.js <formula>
	
where formula is a Boolean formula which is used to build the desired integer
programming model. A short help message is available by the -h option:

	$ js benchmark.js -h
	
The game is read from the standard input. The format is the same as in the
laboratory. As an example

	    5 9
	x5  1 1 Permanent Member
	x10 0 1 Non-permanent Member
	
models the UN Security Council.

Command line arguments for the JavaScript shell can be passed in front of the
JavaScript file benchmark.js, for instance

	$ js -m benchmark.js <formula>
	
can be used to enable just-in-time compilation.
